    content: `On 19 September 2019, an outbreak of polio was declared in the Philippines. Children in the Philippines are at risk of lifelong paralysis because of this outbreak.

    The Philippine Department of Health and partners are working together on a comprehensive outbreak response, including mass polio immunization rounds from October 2019. All children, regardless of whether they are covered by the mass immunization campaign or not, should be vaccinated according to the routine immunization schedule. 
    
    The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) is supporting the Philippine Government’s response. The GPEI is a public-private partnership led by national governments with five partners – the World Health Organization (WHO), Rotary International, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Its goal is to eradicate polio worldwide.
    
    WHO is providing technical advice on the outbreak response, on-the-ground monitoring and support for risk communication.`

    content: `If you follow my Instagram stories, you’ll know that I just recently went through a 10-day detox/juice cleanse. Over the past years, there have been plenty of different views on the practice of juicing after the trend has exploded in 2011-2012.

    Just to make it clear, juicing is not primarily for weight loss. It isn’t a crash diet. The weight you lose in the duration of the cleanse is merely water weight and you’ll most likely gain it back after. What it is though, is a natural means of healing, allowing your body to focus its energy on flushing toxins out on its own with the support of nutrients of, you know it– cold-pressed juice. Is it a diet? It’s not. You can’t live off of cold-pressed juice for a long period of time because of the absence of fiber, protein and fat to name a few. However, juices are rich in a ton of micronutrients and are so potent that your body will actually thrive in them during your cleanse.

    I’ve gone through cycles of cleansing before but always with the headache and hunger pangs. What’s different this round is the absence of any feeling of lightheadedness, of moodiness or lack of energy. I was drinking more juice care of Juju Eats (a total of 3L a day + lemon water) versus the 1.5-2L I would have in my previous cycles. I also feel like the cleanse was deeper with 4 sessions of colon cleanse (coffee enema) c/o Centro Holistico in a week!`

    content: `The Department of Health (DOH) today underscored the critical role of communities in raising awareness and encouraging care and support for People Living with HIV (PLHIV), as it observed the World AIDS Day 2019 with the theme “Communities do make the Difference.”

    The 2018 UNAIDS Global Report cited the Philippines as having the highest percentage increase (203%) of estimated new HIV infections in Asia and the Pacific. “The number of diagnosed HIV cases has also been increasing from one per day in 2008 to 35 per day as of July 2019,” Health Secretary Francisco T. Duque III said.
    
    From January 1984 to July 2019, the regions with the most number of reported cases were NCR (26,832), CALABARZON (10,431), Central Luzon (6,543), Central Visayas (6,153,) and Davao Region (3,917). Among those diagnosed, 94% (65,079) were males, while most of the cases fell under the 25-34 age bracket. 
    
    “The government and its partners are now working double time in preventing, diagnosing, and treating HIV infections in public and private health facilities nationwide,” Duque stressed. Around 143 social hygiene clinics nationwide offer free HIV counseling, testing and community-based HIV screening while 150 HIV Treatment hubs provide treatment services.
    
    The goal of DOH is that 90% of all PLHIVs know their status, 90% of diagnosed PLHIVs receive antiretroviral therapy (ART), and 90% of all receiving ART are virally suppressed. 
    
    “With our existing DOH strategies and our LHIVE FREE campaign, we are optimistic that we can soon curb the increasing number of HIV cases in the country,” Duque said.The LHIVE FREE campaign advocates for testing and adherence to treatment of the most at-risk population and further encourages support groups) to be a part of the PLHIVs journey to wellness.
